# Domains

Although estimators such as Kriging do **not** require equally spaced samples,
many software packages for geostatistical estimation/simulation restrict their
implementations to regular grids. This is a big limitation, however; given that
sampling campaigns and resource exploration is rarely regular.

In GeoStats.jl, estimation/simulation can be performed on arbitrary domain types such
as simple point sets, unstructured meshes, and tesselations. These types are implemented
"analytically" in order to minimize memory access and maximize performance. In a regular
grid, for example, the coordinates of a given location are known, and one can perform
search without ever constructing a grid.

Below is the list of currently implemented domain types. More options will be available
in future releases.
